# nsf-reu-smaller-files
Smaller practice files used to learn and test different methodologies. 

## Smaller projects
A folder which contains five mini-projects used to practice my data science skills. Slightly more detail about each project can be seen in the ipynb notebooks.<br> <br>
The projects are: <br> 
• Logistic Regression Implementation + Spam Classification <br>
• Academic Success Classification <br>
• Automobile Deep Neural Network <br>
• Heart Disease Prediction <br>
• Fake News DistilBERT vectors

## Testing research methods
A folder containing smaller, unpolished files used to test research methods used in my final research project, where I modified the river library to implement novel drift detection methods in online learning for malware opcodes. Note that my final research code is not published since my paper has not yet been published yet. More info about each individual file can be found in the ipynb notebooks. <br>

The files are: <br>
• Comparing malware (adaptive learning) classifiers (Boddukuri replication) <br>
• Research pre-processing and tests <br>
• Word2Vec with CNN, RFC, SVM, and KNN (Kale et. al. replication)
